- Completed the ["Creating Responsive Web Design"][1] today on Lynda. Picked up a few new tools as to different sizes of background images to go with media queries. Nothing ground breaking, but another lesson to the mind and tool to the tool belt.  

- Reviewed the Responsive Web Design Principles on FreeCodeCamp.

- Also did my first Git Push of an official Project I'm working on, which is the [The Potatoe Project][2] to GitHub. Currently working on a seperate branch for the first time.
