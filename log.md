- The last 10 days have been a pretty good one of learning, got to really put to use my CSS skills in just taking things I found on Dribble and applying it with just visually looking at it with different layouts, different selectors, different properties, it's been a really solid to get back into the grove of things just putting in reps in both CSS and HTML. 

- The official end to the [The Potatoe project][2] is here, it's served it's purpose, it's really my first from scratch website with no tutorials or really any guidance, just blank to website, which is a pretty cool moment.

- Feeling pretty confident with my HTML and CSS, going to be flexing that muscle still even in Javascript next week.

- Next week is Javascript, it's taken about 4 months to get to this point, I really wanted to get to a level of understanding with HTML and CSS that I could see something and put it into action. Now it's time to move on, and i'm excited for the beast ahead of me in Javascript.

- Added Two pages to the Potatoe pages, really using that experiment to mess around with Grid alot more, as I've felt way more comfortable with flexbox, and have been using that for most of my packages. 

- Watched the [#LockDownConference][7] by FreeCodeCamp about how developers are adjusting and can gain traction in this pandemic, which was very informative, especially with so much uncertainty, it's certainly a big part of my future to be apart of the community online and in person (when things return to normal), because I feel like you get what you put out.

- Merged my first branch in [The Potatoe project][2] using Command line. Really enjoying Command line, using it in every possible way to make it a permanent habit.

- Completed the ["Creating Responsive Web Design"][1] today on Lynda. Picked up a few new tools as to different sizes of background images to go with media queries. Nothing ground breaking, but another lesson to the mind and tool to the tool belt.  

- Reviewed the Responsive Web Design Principles on FreeCodeCamp.

- Also did my first Git Push of an official Project I'm working on, which is the [The Potatoe Project][2] to GitHub. Currently working on a seperate branch for the first time.
