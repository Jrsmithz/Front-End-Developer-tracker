- Added Two pages to the Potatoe pages, really using that experiment to mess around with Grid alot more, as I've felt way more comfortable with flexbox, and have been using that for most of my packages. 

- Watched the [#LockDownConference][7] by FreeCodeCamp about how developers are adjusting and can gain traction in this pandemic, which was very informative, especially with so much uncertainty, it's certainly a big part of my future to be apart of the community online and in person (when things return to normal), because I feel like you get what you put out.

- Merged my first branch in [The Potatoe project][2] using Command line. Really enjoying Command line, using it in every possible way to make it a permanent habit.

- Completed the ["Creating Responsive Web Design"][1] today on Lynda. Picked up a few new tools as to different sizes of background images to go with media queries. Nothing ground breaking, but another lesson to the mind and tool to the tool belt.  

- Reviewed the Responsive Web Design Principles on FreeCodeCamp.

- Also did my first Git Push of an official Project I'm working on, which is the [The Potatoe Project][2] to GitHub. Currently working on a seperate branch for the first time.
