# My Learning Tracker
---

This will be a complete log of my journey in web development. I made this log with the idea of being able to share my learning resources, my achievements, my mistakes, and my hightlights and lowlights.

A little background was I started my journey January 8th 2020, and I created a personal journal on my journey, until I learned about GIT and GitHub and thought this would be a cool place to have it live forever.
